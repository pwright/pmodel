= Making open source more inclusive

[role="_abstract"]
Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code and documentation.
We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist.
Due to the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be gradually implemented over upcoming releases.
For more details on making our language more inclusive, see our link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[CTO Chris Wrightâ€™s message].
