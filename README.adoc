= Analysing AsciiDoc using `pmodel`

[role="_abstract"]
`pmodel` runs against `adoc` files and produces reports.

To install pmodel:

`npm i -g @techwriter/pmodel`

To test an adoc file:

`pmodel <adoc-file>`

Example output shows that all elements exist:

```
{
"filename":"README.adoc",
"ID":"analysing_{context}", 
"heading":"Analysing AsciiDoc using `pmodel`", 
"abstract":"`pmodel` runs against `adoc` files and produces reports.", 
"dummy":0}
```

To test a directory:

```
cd <dir>
pmodel parse
```

The `parse` keyword triggers pmodel to recursively search for AsciiDoc files and run the test, output can be queried with link:https://alasql-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[alasql].

```
pmodel parse > test.json

alasql 'select heading, abstract from JSON("test.json") where abstract is not null'
```


== Tests

The following tests are performed:

* Capture Level 1 heading. If there are two level 1 headings, both are captured.
* Capture first line after `[role="_ abstract"]`
* Capture id value
